# üåê HTTP-Diff: Multi-Environment API Testing

The HTTP-diff module is FNC's flagship feature for comprehensive API testing and validation across multiple environments. It provides sophisticated capabilities for request chaining, response comparison, and detailed reporting.

## Core Capabilities

### **Multi-Environment Testing**
Execute identical HTTP requests across multiple configured environments and automatically compare responses to identify differences, regressions, or environment-specific issues.

### **Advanced Request Chaining**
Build complex test scenarios with request dependencies, value extraction, and conditional execution. Perfect for authentication flows, data setup, and end-to-end API testing.

### **Professional Reporting**
Generate multiple output formats including interactive terminal UI, structured CLI output, and professional HTML reports suitable for stakeholders and documentation.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Configuration
```bash
# Generate default configuration files
fnc http-diff --init

# This creates:
# - http-diff.toml (main configuration)
# - users.csv (test user data)
```

### 2. Basic Configuration Example
```toml
# http-diff.toml
[environments.dev]
base_url = "https://api-dev.example.com"
headers = { "Accept" = "application/json" }

[environments.staging]
base_url = "https://api-staging.example.com"
headers = { "Accept" = "application/json" }

[environments.prod]
base_url = "https://api.example.com"
headers = { "Accept" = "application/json" }

[[routes]]
name = "health"
method = "GET"
path = "/health"

[[routes]]
name = "user_profile"
method = "GET"
path = "/api/users/{userId}"
headers = { "Authorization" = "Bearer {token}" }
```

### 3. User Data (CSV)
```csv
userId,token,userType
1001,eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...,premium
1002,eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...,basic
```

### 4. Execute Tests
```bash
# Test all environments and routes
fnc http-diff

# Test specific environments
fnc http-diff --environments dev,staging

# Test specific routes
fnc http-diff --routes health,user_profile

# Generate HTML report
fnc http-diff --report results.html

# Force CLI output (disable TUI)
fnc http-diff --no-tui
```

## Configuration Reference

### Environment Configuration

#### Basic Environment Setup
```toml
[environments.development]
base_url = "https://api-dev.company.com"
headers = { 
    "Accept" = "application/json",
    "User-Agent" = "FNC-HttpDiff/1.0",
    "X-Environment" = "development"
}

[environments.production]
base_url = "https://api.company.com"
headers = { 
    "Accept" = "application/json",
    "User-Agent" = "FNC-HttpDiff/1.0"
}
```

```toml
[global]
timeout = 30                    # Request timeout in seconds
max_concurrent = 10             # Maximum concurrent requests
follow_redirects = true         # Follow HTTP redirects
headers = {                     # Headers applied to all requests
    "Accept" = "application/json",
    "User-Agent" = "FNC-HttpDiff/1.0"
}
```

### Route Configuration

#### Simple Routes
```toml
[[routes]]
name = "health_check"
method = "GET"
path = "/health"

[[routes]]
name = "api_status"
method = "GET"
path = "/api/v1/status"
headers = { "X-Health-Check" = "true" }
```

#### Parameterized Routes
```toml
[[routes]]
name = "user_detail"
method = "GET"
path = "/api/users/{userId}"
headers = { "Authorization" = "Bearer {authToken}" }

[[routes]]
name = "create_order"
method = "POST"
path = "/api/orders"
headers = { 
    "Authorization" = "Bearer {authToken}",
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
}
body = '''
{
    "userId": "{userId}",
    "items": [
        {"productId": "{productId}", "quantity": 1}
    ],
    "shippingAddress": "{address}"
}
'''
```

## Advanced Features

### Request Chaining and Dependencies

Build complex test scenarios where requests depend on previous responses:

```toml
# Step 1: Authentication
[[routes]]
name = "login"
method = "POST"
path = "/auth/login"
headers = { "Content-Type" = "application/json" }
body = '''
{
    "username": "{username}",
    "password": "{password}"
}
'''

# Extract auth token from login response
[[routes.extract]]
name = "auth_token"
type = "json_path"
source = "$.access_token"
required = true

[[routes.extract]]
name = "user_id"
type = "json_path"
source = "$.user.id"
required = true

# Step 2: Get user data (depends on login)
[[routes]]
name = "user_profile"
method = "GET"
path = "/api/users/{user_id}"
headers = { "Authorization" = "Bearer {auth_token}" }
depends_on = ["login"]              # Wait for login to complete
wait_for_extraction = true          # Wait for value extraction

# Extract additional data
[[routes.extract]]
name = "user_email"
type = "json_path"
source = "$.email"
required = false
default_value = "unknown@example.com"

# Step 3: Update profile (depends on user_profile)
[[routes]]
name = "update_profile"
method = "PUT"
path = "/api/users/{user_id}/profile"
headers = { 
    "Authorization" = "Bearer {auth_token}",
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
}
body = '''
{
    "email": "{user_email}",
    "updatedBy": "{username}"
}
'''
depends_on = ["user_profile"]
wait_for_extraction = true
```

### Value Extraction System

Extract values from responses for use in subsequent requests:

#### JSON Path Extraction
```toml
[[routes.extract]]
name = "order_id"
type = "json_path"
source = "$.data.order.id"
required = true

[[routes.extract]]
name = "total_amount"
type = "json_path"
source = "$.data.order.total"
required = false
default_value = "0.00"
```

#### Regular Expression Extraction
```toml
[[routes.extract]]
name = "transaction_id"
type = "regex"
source = "Transaction ID: ([A-Z0-9]+)"
required = true

[[routes.extract]]
name = "session_token"
type = "regex"
source = "token=([a-f0-9]+)"
required = false
default_value = "no-token"
```

#### Header Extraction
```toml
[[routes.extract]]
name = "request_id"
type = "header"
source = "X-Request-ID"
required = false

[[routes.extract]]
name = "rate_limit"
type = "header"
source = "X-RateLimit-Remaining"
required = false
default_value = "unknown"
```

#### Status Code Extraction
```toml
[[routes.extract]]
name = "response_status"
type = "status_code"
required = true
```

### Conditional Execution

Execute routes conditionally based on user data or extracted values:

```toml
[[routes]]
name = "premium_features"
method = "GET"
path = "/api/premium/features"
headers = { "Authorization" = "Bearer {auth_token}" }

# Only execute for premium users
[routes.conditions]
field = "userType"
operator = "equals"
value = "premium"

[[routes]]
name = "admin_dashboard"
method = "GET"
path = "/api/admin/dashboard"
headers = { "Authorization" = "Bearer {auth_token}" }

# Only execute if user has admin role (from extracted value)
[routes.conditions]
field = "user_role"
operator = "equals"
value = "admin"

[[routes]]
name = "high_value_orders"
method = "GET"
path = "/api/orders/high-value"
headers = { "Authorization" = "Bearer {auth_token}" }

# Only execute if order total is above threshold
[routes.conditions]
field = "total_amount"
operator = "greater_than"
value = "1000.00"
```

#### Supported Condition Operators
- `equals` / `not_equals`: Exact string matching
- `contains` / `not_contains`: Substring matching
- `greater_than` / `less_than`: Numeric comparison
- `exists` / `not_exists`: Check if field exists and is not empty
